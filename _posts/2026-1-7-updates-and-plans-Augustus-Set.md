title: Update on Augustus Starfish Set 1/7/2026
---
Hi it's Sam again, I have now fully completed the BLAST processing of Augustus Set. Now, I've started on the interpretation of those protiens utilizing UniProt. Since I need to compare which protiens are being transcribed for each of the starfish species in Augustus Set, P. ochraceus, P. helianthoides, and D. imbricata, I have created this little matrix with Excel:

The matrix utilizes a simple function which goes through box in a given column and checks to see if the protein labeled there appears at all in another column, if it does, the protein is printed in an output column comparing the two. I also wrote a version of it to look for protiens that are present in one column but absent from another. Using this set of functions, I am able to compare proteins across species easily and generate lists to run through Uniprot. Continuing my analysis and generation of UNIProt results with the Augustus data is my  objective. Additionally, I am aiming to find out more about the Augustus data set and the nomeclature utilized to name each set, I plan to ask Dr. Roberts about that.
